# LeetCode Solutions in Java - GitHub Repository

## Description

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to housing my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in Java. This collection serves as a comprehensive showcase of my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency in Java.

**Repository Link:** https://github.com/sohumcs/Leetcode-Solutions

## Features

### 1. Organized Structure

The repository is meticulously organized to provide easy navigation. Each LeetCode problem has its own dedicated folder, named according to the problem's title or ID. This ensures clarity and helps fellow developers quickly find solutions.

### 2. Java Implementation

All solutions are written in Java, showcasing my proficiency in the language. Each file contains well-commented code, explaining the thought process and approach taken to solve the problem. This not only serves as a reference for others but also reinforces my understanding of algorithmic concepts.

### 3. Readme Files

Every folder contains a `README.md` file, providing a brief description of the problem, the approach used, and any additional insights. These readme files serve as documentation for each solution, making it easier for collaborators or potential employers to understand my thought process.

### 4. Test Cases

For each solution, a set of test cases is included in the `README.md` file to validate the correctness of the implementation. This ensures that the solutions not only pass the provided examples but are robust and handle various edge cases.

### 5. Continuous Updates

I am committed to continuously updating this repository as I solve more LeetCode problems or optimize existing solutions. This reflects my dedication to ongoing learning and improvement as a developer.

## How to Contribute

I welcome contributions from the community! If you have alternative solutions, improvements, or suggestions, please feel free to open a pull request. Let's collaborate and create a valuable resource for developers navigating the world of LeetCode!

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the LeetCode community and the open-source ecosystem, which has been instrumental in my growth as a programmer.
